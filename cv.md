## Short introduction

My goal is to become a professional Java Script developer. I've never worked in this field before, but to change the area you're used to and to leave a comfort zone is common practice in many Western countries. I'm actually interested in this new experience, I learn fast and I've already jumped in, because the main part of any process is always self-education and own desire to become better.

## Skills

I have a little experience in Java Script and HTML, CSS. Now I'm in learning process.

## Experience

2018\. Java Fundamentals Course by IT-Academy

2021\. Video Course on udemy.com "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann

## Code example

```javascript
// Tabbed component

tabsContainer.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  const clicked = e.target.closest('.operations__tab');

  // Guard clause
  if (!clicked) return;

  // Remove active classes
  tabs.forEach(t => t.classList.remove('operations__tab--active'));
  tabsContent.forEach(c => c.classList.remove('operations__content--active'));

  // Activate tab
  clicked.classList.add('operations__tab--active');

  // Activate content area
  document
    .querySelector(`.operations__content--${clicked.dataset.tab}`)
    .classList.add('operations__content--active');
});
```

## Language

English, B2. I successfully completed Streamline English Course at Upper Intermediate level in 2019.

I'd been working in the sport journalism for 10 years before last autumn (last 3 years as a Deputy Editor-in-chief of "Pressball", the most popular sport edition and web site in Belarus). My duties included correspondence with different foreign structures (for instance, International Olympic committee) and business trips, where I had an opportunity to apply language skills and keep it active. Besides, I translated some own essays for international competition (The AIPS Sport Media Awards).

In addition, for two years I've been working as a Venue Data Coordinator at international football matches under the aegis UEFA, where all communication is in English.
