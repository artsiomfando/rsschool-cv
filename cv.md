## Short introduction

My goal is to become a professional Java Script developer. I've never worked in this field before, but to change the area you're used to and to leave a comfort zone is common practice in many Western countries. I'm actually interested in this new experience, I learn fast and I've already jumped in, because the main part of any process is always self-education and own desire to become better.

## Skills

I have a little experience in Java Script. Now I'm in learning process.

## Experience

2018\. Java Fundamentals Course by IT-Academy

2021\. Video Course on udemy.com "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann

## Education

2007 — 2012. Belorussian National Technical University with a degree in economics

2012 — 2013. Belorussian National Technical University (master courses)

\*Graduated with excellent certificate in economics

## Language

English B2. I successfully completed Streamline English Course at Upper Intermediate level in 2019.

I'd been working in the sport journalism for 10 years before last autumn (last 3 years as a Deputy Editor-in-chief of "Pressball", the most popular sport edition and web site in Belarus). My duties included correspondence with different foreign structures (for instance, International Olympic committee) and business trips, where I had an opportunity to apply language skills and keep it active. Besides, I translated some own essays for international competition (The AIPS Sport Media Awards).

In addition, for two years I've been working as a Venue Data Coordinator at international football matches under the aegis UEFA, where all communication is in English.
